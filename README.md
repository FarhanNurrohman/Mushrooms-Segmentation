# Mushroom Classification and Clustering with K-Means
This machine learning project utilizes the K-Means clustering algorithm to analyze and classify mushrooms based on their features, determining whether they are edible or inedible.

## Features:
* Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lizhecheng/mushroom-classification Contains various mushroom attributes like cap shape, color, gill attachment, and more.
* Preprocessing: Handles categorical data with encoding techniques for compatibility with the K-Means algorithm.
* Clustering: Implements K-Means to group mushrooms into clusters for classification.
* Visualization: Provides plots to illustrate clustering results and feature relationships.
* Evaluation: Assesses the effectiveness of clustering with metrics like silhouette scores.
## Goal:
To explore unsupervised learning techniques and cluster mushrooms effectively, aiding in identifying their edibility.
